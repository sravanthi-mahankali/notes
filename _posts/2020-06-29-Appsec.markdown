All the important concepts in App Sec and quick referce to what I learned
#### [Known Vulnerabilities](link should be here)
### Security Blankets
* Awareness
* Build Security from start
* Defense in depth
* Privacy of information
* Least privilage
* Whitelisting (then Blacklisting)
* Minimize attact area
* Don't use untrust data
* Seperate data from code
* Don't trust input
* Secure by default
* You can't secure what you don't understand
* Keep secrets secret
* Secruity must be usable 
* Stay up to date
* use existing security solution (Don't reinvent the wheel)

## Intro to Threat Modeling

What :
   ```
   identify risks & mitigation Strategies 
    (who involued)
       -> Product owners
       -> Delivery Team
       -> Domain experts
       -> Security SME
       -> Business owners
   ```
   ---

> **_NOTE:_**  One pill for all Ills (Threat Modeling).

Things each role should consider:

| Business / Product owners | Delivery Team  | 
| ------------- |:-------------|
| -> What kind of inverstments should I make ? | -> How do i minimise the impact of a breach |
|  -> Do I really need to worry | -> Are we focusing on the right area to secure |
| -> What should i secure | -> What tech controls we put in |
| -> Where do we begin | -> Where do we begin |


> Threat modeling can be viewed in 2 levels
 - Business Level
 - Appication Level

### Business Level Threat Modeling

#### PreCursors
> ### Understanding CIA
    Why to protect is decided based on CIA triad
       -> C - confidentiality
       -> I - integrity
       -> A - Avaulability
       
> ### Identify Business workflows
    if business flows are identified we can apply CIA

> ### Identify Actors
    why to list 
      -> to identify the entities that participate in the system 
      -> to understand the system before you start threat modeling 
         so that you can consider the possible risks of their interaction

### Appication Level Threat Modeling

#### PreCursors
        S T R I D E

### S - Spoofing 
                Pretending to be someone or something else
                
### T - Tampering
                Maliciously modify data or code for persistant
                           data or data in transit

### R - Repudation 
                To ilegally perform actions that can't be traced back
                           to the origin of the action

### I - Information Disclosure
                Expose information to someone not authorised

### D - Denial of service
                To deny or degrade the services requests by users

### E - Elevation od privilege
                To gain authorised permisions beyond those
                            initially granted

#### Approches to application threat modeling

1. Data flow diagrams

    create a data flow  ----> identify the trusted boundaries --------> idenfiy threats (using STRIDE)
2. Cornucopia cards

    its a game based approach developed by owasp
3. Attack trees

    wear the hat of aattacker (depth of the security is optained)
