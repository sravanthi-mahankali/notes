# Difference Between Agile and water fall

| Water fall              | Agile                 |
| ----------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Prescriptive            | Abstract              |
| Extensive documentation | Minimal documentation |
| Sequential              | Continuous            |
| Formal                  | Informal              |
| Process focus           | Communication focus   |
| Gradual change          | Rapid change          |

# Manifesto for Agile Software development

- **Indiviuals and interactions** over process and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

# Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile process harness change for the customer's ccompetitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frquently, form a couple of weeks tp a couple od months, with a preference to the shorer timescale.
- Business people and developer must work together daily throughtout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Agile processes promote sustainable development.The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintian a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

## Extreme Programming (XP)
- Techniques and Principle
    - Frequent releases and short dev cycles
    - Pair programming
    - Regular builds and intergartion tests
    - Quality and avoiding code breakage.
    - Simplicity of code, coding only what is needed
    - Rapid and regular feedback

## SCRUM 
- Techniques and principles
    - Product Backlog
    - Sprint Backlog
    - Daily sync /standups
    - iterartion/sprints 2-4 weeks
    - Potentially shiappable product increment.

## Feature Driven Development
- Techniques and Principles
    - 2 Week iterations
    - **Create the model** - Perform an inital customer walkthrought that determine scope and context and creates the model.
    - **Develop the feature list** - The model determine the features
    -  **Proritise the features**
        - The plan is determined by features -  FDD advocates that teams create a development plan that is based on orderining them to classes. Classes are then assigned to an owning developers.
        - The design is based on the features - The owning developer assigns a set of features that can be developed in two weeks. Detailed ssequence diagrams are created based on features and the overall model is updated to reflact the changes. Classes are written, and design review is held.
        - The bild is based on the features -  Code is developd based on feedback from the design review. Once the developer completes the code and unit testing. then a code review is held to analyze whether final changes are needed. Final updates to the code are made and the code promoted to current build.
