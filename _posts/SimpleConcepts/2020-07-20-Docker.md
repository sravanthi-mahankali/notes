### Why Cotainers :-
- VM provides isolation
  - disadvantages 
    - 2 os are persent
      -> Resourse utiization (CPU , RAM, DISK consumed by the guest os)
      -> Performance over head (multiple os + hypevisor)
      -> Cost overhead (maintanance + license etc)
Container = (VM - Guest os)

=> Container uses CGroups 
- allows limitations & priorization of resources
- Name space isolation
