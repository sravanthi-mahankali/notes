### Introduction

- monolith many calls --- difficult to handle
- break down to different services handling its own calls and data
- how to eliminate the synchronous communication ---> message queues
- one queue for - one service ------------> complex architecture
- a services which maintains all queues ----> enterprise messaging queue system 

#### Enterprise messaging queue system

- produces used to add the message in to the queue of the consumer and consumer will consume it 
- if a new consumer is added - new queue created and producer should add the message to it 
- ie, when a new service is added, we should handle the producer to publish the messages to new queue
- made the communication asyasynchronousnchronus but didn't eliminate the tight coupling 

### How / Why kafka introduced

- To slove the problem of linked in which involues the communication between audit system and monitoring system 
- features they require 
    - persist the events/ messages
    - high streaming capability
    - push - pull model 
    - horizontal scaling

### features of kafka
   - multiple connectors support
   - uses containers

### vocabulary 
 - producer consumer
 - topic
 - partition
 - brokers / clusters
 

> topic     
        -  logical collection of messages 
        -   one topic - many partitions

> partition 
    - physical entity which store the messages 
    - each messages is stored with some offset (some thing like indexing)
    - one partition -> one topic

> brokers     
    - one broker many partitions of different topics

> comsumer group - group of the same consumer
